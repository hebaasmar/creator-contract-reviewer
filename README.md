# Creator Contract Reviewer

An AI-powered tool that analyzes creator contracts and flags potential issues before you sign.

## The Problem

Creators sign brand deals, sponsorship agreements, and partnership contracts without legal review. Most can't afford a lawyer for every $500 deal. They miss red flags - exclusive rights that last too long, payment terms that favor the brand, termination clauses that leave them stuck.

## What It Does

Paste a contract and get:
- **Red flags** with severity ratings (high/medium/low)
- **Negotiable terms** with specific suggestions for what to ask for
- **Questions to ask** before signing

## How It Works

- Next.js frontend
- Claude API for contract analysis
- Structured prompts that extract specific contract elements and evaluate them against common creator-contract pitfalls

## Built With

TypeScript, Next.js, Anthropic Claude API
